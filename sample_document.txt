Welcome to the AI Chatbot Documentation

This is a sample text document that can be uploaded to the AI chatbot for testing the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) functionality.

About the AI Chatbot:
The AI Chatbot is a sophisticated backend API that allows users to interact with an intelligent assistant. The chatbot can answer questions, provide information, and help with various tasks.

Key Features:
1. Intelligent Conversations - The chatbot uses advanced language models to understand and respond to user queries.
2. Document Context - Users can upload documents (PDF or TXT) to provide additional context.
3. Session Management - All conversations are organized by sessions, keeping your chats separate.
4. Conversation History - The chatbot remembers the entire conversation history.
5. Multiple LLM Support - Works with OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude.

How it Works:
When you upload a document, the system breaks it down into smaller chunks and creates vector embeddings. When you ask a question, the system finds the most relevant chunks from your uploaded documents and uses them along with the conversation history to generate contextual responses.

Technical Details:
- Built with FastAPI for high performance
- Uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient vector storage
- Implements RAG using LangChain
- Supports multiple language model providers
- Fully containerized with Docker

Example Use Cases:
- Upload a research paper and ask questions about it
- Upload product documentation and get instant answers
- Upload meeting notes and query specific details
- Upload a book chapter and discuss its contents

This document serves as a test file to demonstrate the RAG capabilities of the chatbot.
